# ElevatorSimulator
An elevator system simulation

This is a project I was able to work on through the Summer of 2019 in my Scrum Techniques class. The only instructions given were the ones below and what our Product Owner would like to have seen throughout our Sprint Cycles.

This is a "green field" Java project; that is, there is no initial code base. PO wants
a basic, text-based elevator simulation to explore various elevator system parameters 
(such as, multiple cars, varying numbers of floors, express cars, timing adjustments, 
etc.). There are a number of expected enhancements that will emerge as project 
progresses.
